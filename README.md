```bash
python examples/assorted_checks/test_openai/test_openai_tts.py # Test OpenAI Compatibility
python examples/assorted_checks/test_voices/test_all_voices.py # Test all available voices
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Voice Combination</summary>

- Weighted voice combinations using ratios (e.g., "af_bella(2)+af_heart(1)" for 67%/33% mix)
- Ratios are automatically normalized to sum to 100%
- Available through any endpoint by adding weights in parentheses
- Saves generated voicepacks for future use

Combine voices and generate audio:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voices")
voices = response.json()["voices"]

# Example 1: Simple voice combination (50%/50% mix)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella+af_sky",  # Equal weights
        "response_format": "mp3"
    }
)

# Example 2: Weighted voice combination (67%/33% mix)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella(2)+af_sky(1)",  # 2:1 ratio = 67%/33%
        "response_format": "mp3"
    }
)

# Example 3: Download combined voice as .pt file
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voices/combine",
    json="af_bella(2)+af_sky(1)"  # 2:1 ratio = 67%/33%
)

# Save the .pt file
with open("combined_voice.pt", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)

# Use the downloaded voice file
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "combined_voice",  # Use the saved voice file
        "response_format": "mp3"
    }

<summary>Streaming Support</summary>

```python
# OpenAI-compatible streaming
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8880/v1", api_key="not-needed")

# Stream to file
with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
    model="kokoro",
    voice="af_bella",
    input="Hello world!"
) as response:
    response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")

# Stream to speakers (requires PyAudio)
import pyaudio
player = pyaudio.PyAudio().open(
    format=pyaudio.paInt16, 
    channels=1, 
    rate=24000, 
    output=True
)

with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
    model="kokoro",
    voice="af_bella",
    response_format="pcm",
    input="Hello world!"
) as response:
    for chunk in response.iter_bytes(chunk_size=1024):
        player.write(chunk)
```

Or via requests:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "response_format": "pcm"
    },
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
    if chunk:
        # Process streaming chunks
        pass
```

    - ~3500ms (CPU) @ 200 (older i7)
    - ~<1s    (CPU) @ 200 (M3 Pro)
- Adjustable chunking settings for real-time playback 

*Note: Artifacts in intonation can increase with smaller chunks*
</details>

## Processing Details
<details>
<summary>Performance Benchmarks</summary>

Benchmarking was performed on generation via the local API using text lengths up to feature-length books (~1.5 hours output), measuring processing time and realtime factor. Tests were run on: 
- Windows 11 Home w/ WSL2 
- NVIDIA 4060Ti 16gb GPU @ CUDA 12.1
- 11th Gen i7-11700 @ 2.5GHz
- 64gb RAM
- WAV native output
- H.G. Wells - The Time Machine (full text)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/gpu_processing_time.png" width="45%" alt="Processing Time" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; margin-right: 1%;">
  <img src="assets/gpu_realtime_factor.png" width="45%" alt="Realtime Factor" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px;">
</p>

Key Performance Metrics:
- Realtime Speed: Ranges between 35x-100x (generation time to output audio length)
- Average Processing Rate: 137.67 tokens/second (cl100k_base)
</details>
<details>
<summary>GPU Vs. CPU</summary>

```bash
# GPU: Requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.8 support (~35x-100x realtime speed)
cd docker/gpu
docker compose up --build

# CPU: PyTorch CPU inference
cd docker/cpu
docker compose up --build

```
*Note: Overall speed may have reduced somewhat with the structural changes to accommodate streaming. Looking into it* 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Natural Boundary Detection</summary>

- Automatically splits and stitches at sentence boundaries 
- Helps to reduce artifacts and allow long form processing as the base model is only currently configured for approximately 30s output

The model is capable of processing up to a 510 phonemized token chunk at a time, however, this can often lead to 'rushed' speech or other artifacts. An additional layer of chunking is applied in the server, that creates flexible chunks with a `TARGET_MIN_TOKENS` , `TARGET_MAX_TOKENS`, and `ABSOLUTE_MAX_TOKENS` which are configurable via environment variables, and set to 175, 250, 450 by default

</details>

<details>
<summary>Timestamped Captions & Phonemes</summary>

Generate audio with word-level timestamps without streaming:
```python
import requests
import base64
import json

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/dev/captioned_speech",
    json={
        "model": "kokoro",
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "speed": 1.0,
        "response_format": "mp3",
        "stream": False,
    },
    stream=False
)

with open("output.mp3","wb") as f:

    audio_json=json.loads(response.content)
    
    # Decode base 64 stream to bytes
    chunk_audio=base64.b64decode(audio_json["audio"].encode("utf-8"))
    
    # Process streaming chunks
    f.write(chunk_audio)
    
    # Print word level timestamps
    print(audio_json["timestamps"])
```

Generate audio with word-level timestamps with streaming:
```python
import requests
import base64
import json

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/dev/captioned_speech",
    json={
        "model": "kokoro",
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "speed": 1.0,
        "response_format": "mp3",
        "stream": True,
    },
    stream=True
)

f=open("output.mp3","wb")
for chunk in response.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
    if chunk:
        chunk_json=json.loads(chunk)
        
        # Decode base 64 stream to bytes
        chunk_audio=base64.b64decode(chunk_json["audio"].encode("utf-8"))
        
        # Process streaming chunks
        f.write(chunk_audio)
        
        # Print word level timestamps
        print(chunk_json["timestamps"])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Phoneme & Token Routes</summary>

Convert text to phonemes and/or generate audio directly from phonemes:
```python
import requests

def get_phonemes(text: str, language: str = "a"):
    """Get phonemes and tokens for input text"""
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8880/dev/phonemize",
        json={"text": text, "language": language}  # "a" for American English
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    result = response.json()
    return result["phonemes"], result["tokens"]

def generate_audio_from_phonemes(phonemes: str, voice: str = "af_bella"):
    """Generate audio from phonemes"""
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8880/dev/generate_from_phonemes",
        json={"phonemes": phonemes, "voice": voice},
        headers={"Accept": "audio/wav"}
    )
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Error: {response.text}")
        return None
    return response.content

# Example usage
text = "Hello world!"
try:
    # Convert text to phonemes
    phonemes, tokens = get_phonemes(text)
    print(f"Phonemes: {phonemes}")  # e.g. ðɪs ɪz ˈoʊnli ɐ tˈɛst
    print(f"Tokens: {tokens}")      # Token IDs including start/end tokens

    # Generate and save audio
    if audio_bytes := generate_audio_from_phonemes(phonemes):
        with open("speech.wav", "wb") as f:
            f.write(audio_bytes)
        print(f"Generated {len(audio_bytes)} bytes of audio")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

See `examples/phoneme_examples/generate_phonemes.py` for a sample script.

<details>
<summary>Debug Endpoints</summary>

Monitor system state and resource usage with these endpoints:

- `/debug/threads` - Get thread information and stack traces
- `/debug/storage` - Monitor temp file and output directory usage
- `/debug/system` - Get system information (CPU, memory, GPU)
- `/debug/session_pools` - View ONNX session and CUDA stream status

Useful for debugging resource exhaustion or performance issues.
</details>

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Missing words & Missing some timestamps</summary>

The api will automaticly do text normalization on input text which may incorrectly remove or change some phrases. This can be disabled by adding `"normalization_options":{"normalize": false}` to your request json:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_heart",
        "response_format": "pcm",
        "normalization_options":
        {
            "normalize": False
        }
    },
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
    if chunk:
        # Process streaming chunks
        pass
```
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Versioning & Development</summary>

**Branching Strategy:**
*   **`release` branch:** Contains the latest stable build, recommended for production use. Docker images tagged with specific versions (e.g., `v0.3.0`) are built from this branch.
*   **`master` branch:** Used for active development. It may contain experimental features, ongoing changes, or fixes not yet in a stable release. Use this branch if you want the absolute latest code, but be aware it might be less stable. The `latest` Docker tag often points to builds from this branch.

Note: This is a *development* focused project at its core. 

If you run into trouble, you may have to roll back a version on the release tags if something comes up, or build up from source and/or troubleshoot + submit a PR.

Free and open source is a community effort, and there's only really so many hours in a day. If you'd like to support the work, feel free to open a PR, buy me a coffee, or report any bugs/features/etc you find during use.

<summary>Linux GPU Permissions</summary>

Some Linux users may encounter GPU permission issues when running as non-root. 
Can't guarantee anything, but here are some common solutions, consider your security requirements carefully

### Option 1: Container Groups (Likely the best option)
```yaml
services:
  kokoro-tts:
    # ... existing config ...
    group_add:
      - "video"
      - "render"
```

### Option 2: Host System Groups
```yaml
services:
  kokoro-tts:
    # ... existing config ...
    user: "${UID}:${GID}"
    group_add:
      - "video"
```
Note: May require adding host user to groups: `sudo usermod -aG docker,video $USER` and system restart.

### Option 3: Device Permissions (Use with caution)
```yaml
services:
  kokoro-tts:
    # ... existing config ...
    devices:
      - /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0
      - /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl
      - /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm
```
⚠️ Warning: Reduces system security. Use only in development environments.

Prerequisites: NVIDIA GPU, drivers, and container toolkit must be properly configured.
