## Quick Start

The service can be accessed through either the API endpoints or the Gradio web interface.

1. Install prerequisites, and start the service using Docker Compose (Full setup including UI):
   - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI.git
        cd Kokoro-FastAPI
        
        #   * Switch to stable branch if any issues *
        git checkout v0.0.5post1-stable

        cd docker/gpu # OR 
        # cd docker/cpu # Run this or the above
        docker compose up --build 
        ```
        
  __Or__ running the API alone using Docker (model + voice packs baked in) (Most Recent):
          
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8880:8880 ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:v0.1.0post1 # CPU 
  docker run --gpus all -p 8880:8880 ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-gpu:v0.1.0post1 # Nvidia GPU
  ```
        
        
2. Run locally as an OpenAI-Compatible Speech Endpoint
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="http://localhost:8880/v1",
        api_key="not-needed"
        )

    with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
        model="kokoro", 
        voice="af_sky+af_bella", #single or multiple voicepack combo
        input="Hello world!",
        response_format="mp3"
    ) as response:
        response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
    
    ```

    or visit http://localhost:7860

    </p>

## Features 
<details>
<summary>OpenAI-Compatible Speech Endpoint</summary>

```python
# Using OpenAI's Python library
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8880/v1", api_key="not-needed")
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="kokoro",  # Not used but required for compatibility, also accepts library defaults
    voice="af_bella+af_sky",
    input="Hello world!",
    response_format="mp3"
)

response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
```
Or Via Requests:
```python
import requests


response = requests.get("http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voices")
voices = response.json()["voices"]

# Generate audio
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "kokoro",  # Not used but required for compatibility
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "response_format": "mp3",  # Supported: mp3, wav, opus, flac
        "speed": 1.0
    }
)

# Save audio
with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

Quick tests (run from another terminal):
```bash
python examples/assorted_checks/test_openai/test_openai_tts.py # Test OpenAI Compatibility
python examples/assorted_checks/test_voices/test_all_voices.py # Test all available voices
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Voice Combination</summary>

- Averages model weights of any existing voicepacks
- Saves generated voicepacks for future use
- (new) Available through any endpoint, simply concatenate desired packs with "+"

Combine voices and generate audio:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voices")
voices = response.json()["voices"]

# Create combined voice (saves locally on server)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voices/combine",
    json=[voices[0], voices[1]]
)
combined_voice = response.json()["voice"]

# Generate audio with combined voice (or, simply pass multiple directly with `+` )
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": combined_voice, # or skip the above step with f"{voices[0]}+{voices[1]}"
        "response_format": "mp3"
    }
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Gradio Web Utility</summary>

Access the interactive web UI at http://localhost:7860 after starting the service. Features include:
- Voice/format/speed selection
- Audio playback and download
- Text file or direct input

If you only want the API, just comment out everything in the docker-compose.yml under and including `gradio-ui`

Currently, voices created via the API are accessible here, but voice combination/creation has not yet been added

*Note: Recent updates for streaming could lead to temporary glitches. If so, pull from the most recent stable release v0.0.2 to restore*

### Disabling Local Saving

You can disable local saving of audio files and hide the file view in the UI by setting the `DISABLE_LOCAL_SAVING` environment variable to `true`. This is useful when running the service on a server where you don't want to store generated audio files locally.

When using Docker Compose:
```yaml
environment:
  - DISABLE_LOCAL_SAVING=true
```

When running the Docker image directly:
```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 -e DISABLE_LOCAL_SAVING=true ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-ui:latest
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Streaming Support</summary>

```python
# OpenAI-compatible streaming
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8880", api_key="not-needed")

# Stream to file
with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
    model="kokoro",
    voice="af_bella",
    input="Hello world!"
) as response:
    response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")

# Stream to speakers (requires PyAudio)
import pyaudio
player = pyaudio.PyAudio().open(
    format=pyaudio.paInt16, 
    channels=1, 
    rate=24000, 
    output=True
)

with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
    model="kokoro",
    voice="af_bella",
    response_format="pcm",
    input="Hello world!"
) as response:
    for chunk in response.iter_bytes(chunk_size=1024):
        player.write(chunk)
```

Or via requests:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "input": "Hello world!",
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "response_format": "pcm"
    },
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
    if chunk:
        # Process streaming chunks
        pass
```

  <img src="assets/cpu_first_token_timeline_stream_openai.png" width="45%" alt="CPU First Token Timeline" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px;">
</p>

Key Streaming Metrics:
- First token latency @ chunksize
    - ~300ms  (GPU) @ 400 
    - ~3500ms (CPU) @ 200 (older i7)
    - ~<1s    (CPU) @ 200 (M3 Pro)
- Adjustable chunking settings for real-time playback 

*Note: Artifacts in intonation can increase with smaller chunks*

## Processing Details
<details>
<summary>Performance Benchmarks</summary>

Benchmarking was performed on generation via the local API using text lengths up to feature-length books (~1.5 hours output), measuring processing time and realtime factor. Tests were run on: 
- Windows 11 Home w/ WSL2 
- NVIDIA 4060Ti 16gb GPU @ CUDA 12.1
- 11th Gen i7-11700 @ 2.5GHz
- 64gb RAM
- WAV native output
- H.G. Wells - The Time Machine (full text)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/gpu_processing_time.png" width="45%" alt="Processing Time" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px; margin-right: 1%;">
  <img src="assets/gpu_realtime_factor.png" width="45%" alt="Realtime Factor" style="border: 2px solid #333; padding: 10px;">
</p>

Key Performance Metrics:
- Realtime Speed: Ranges between 25-50x (generation time to output audio length)
- Average Processing Rate: 137.67 tokens/second (cl100k_base)
</details>
<details>
<summary>GPU Vs. CPU</summary>

```bash
# GPU: Requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.1 support (~35x realtime speed)
docker compose up --build

# CPU: ONNX optimized inference (~2.4x realtime speed)
docker compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml up --build
```
*Note: Overall speed may have reduced somewhat with the structural changes to accomodate streaming. Looking into it* 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Natural Boundary Detection</summary>

- Automatically splits and stitches at sentence boundaries 
- Helps to reduce artifacts and allow long form processing as the base model is only currently configured for approximately 30s output 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Phoneme & Token Routes</summary>

Convert text to phonemes and/or generate audio directly from phonemes:
```python
import requests

# Convert text to phonemes
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/dev/phonemize",
    json={
        "text": "Hello world!",
        "language": "a"  # "a" for American English
    }
)
result = response.json()
phonemes = result["phonemes"]  # Phoneme string e.g  ðɪs ɪz ˈoʊnli ɐ tˈɛst
tokens = result["tokens"]      # Token IDs including start/end tokens 

# Generate audio from phonemes
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8880/dev/generate_from_phonemes",
    json={
        "phonemes": phonemes,
        "voice": "af_bella",
        "speed": 1.0
    }
)

# Save WAV audio
with open("speech.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

See `examples/phoneme_examples/generate_phonemes.py` for a sample script.

## Known Issues

<details>
<summary>Versioning & Development</summary>

I'm doing what I can to keep things stable, but we are on an early and rapid set of build cycles here.
If you run into trouble, you may have to roll back a version on the release tags if something comes up, or build up from source and/or troubleshoot + submit a PR. Will leave the branch up here for the last known stable points:

`v0.0.5post1`

Free and open source is a community effort, and I love working on this project, though there's only really so many hours in a day. If you'd like to support the work, feel free to open a PR, buy me a coffee, or report any bugs/features/etc you find during use.

<details>
<summary>Linux GPU Permissions</summary>

Some Linux users may encounter GPU permission issues when running as non-root. 
Can't guarantee anything, but here are some common solutions, consider your security requirements carefully

### Option 1: Container Groups (Likely the best option)
```yaml
services:
  kokoro-tts:
    # ... existing config ...
    group_add:
      - "video"
      - "render"
```

### Option 2: Host System Groups
```yaml
services:
  kokoro-tts:
    # ... existing config ...
    user: "${UID}:${GID}"
    group_add:
      - "video"
```
Note: May require adding host user to groups: `sudo usermod -aG docker,video $USER` and system restart.

### Option 3: Device Permissions (Use with caution)
```yaml
services:
  kokoro-tts:
    # ... existing config ...
    devices:
      - /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0
      - /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl
      - /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm
```
⚠️ Warning: Reduces system security. Use only in development environments.

Prerequisites: NVIDIA GPU, drivers, and container toolkit must be properly configured.
